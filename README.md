# LSH-text-based-IR
CS F469 IR Assignment - 2

AIM: designing a text based information retrieval system using Locality
Sensitive Hashing

Programming language: Python

Dataset: DNA dataset from Kaggle

Work done: 
Finding duplicate or similar DNA sequences.
Each DNA sequence is made up of four bases.
all the three sub-procedures for Shingling, Min-hashing and LSH step have been implemented. 
Jaccard similarity metric and itâ€™s respective hashing technique is used to find Signature matrix.

Our model ensures real-time retrieval in least possible time. (No preprocessing to calculate Jaccard Similarity or finding similarity between docs is done, yet it gives quick results)
